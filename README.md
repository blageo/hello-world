# About Me

My name is Geoff and I am based in the United states. This is the beginning of my personal development github under my moniker, blageo. I plan on remaining active on this account and getting involved with various open-source projects to develop my skills. I work in IT and am interested in the intersection of software development and IT operations. I am a self-taught coder and am focused on developing skills and projects that will aid my career and personal life. I love to create music and can sing as well as play a few instruments including guitar, bass, and piano. I've played in multiple bands in my life and at one point my primary career was music.
